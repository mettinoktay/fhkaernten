\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Verdict}

The study has demostated the characteristics and capabilities of the components. Although many of the requirements are satisfied, the unsatisfied requirement \textbf{1b} is a concern from control systems perspective as it has shown that using 10 bit ADC yields a performance below the requirement. Furthermore, the ADC of the MCU has a $\pm$ 2 LSB accuracy \cite{ATMEGA328PB}. This aspect further amplifies the temperature error. Therefore, it is advised to employ at least 11 bit ADC.

The sensor seems to be very good choice as it passes all the requirements by quite a margin. Furthermore, it can be easily sourced. It is safe to claim that the high demand all around the world for temperature sensing is the guarantee that such sensors will always be affordable and accessible.

From financial point of view, project seems to be overfunded by almost \%49. The rest of the budget can be spent on upgrading the MCU.
