3D printers have taken over the world over the last decade and
they have
found use in industry, as well as in homes. The convenience of producing
plastic parts at homes gathered attention of many hobbyists and makers. In
industry, the increasing production speed of 3D printers has made
them suitable for rapid-prototyping, saving immense amount of time and
money. Civil engineers and architects also found use
cases for 3D printers. For example, Mayorship of Istanbul has built its own
3D printed
local service buildings within a week with a fraction of cost and build
complexity.

Hotend temperature must be kept stable as fluctuations in hotend
temperature would cause quality issues on the product, e.g. uneven surface
finish and/or material deposition, or nozzle clog. Therefore, the frequency
at which the temperature is measured plays an important role. Also, since
the sensor is placed at the carriage, its weight plays an important role in
position control. However, a PTC thermistor is never of high mass,
therefore this study will assume that the mass of the carriage will remain
relatively same.
