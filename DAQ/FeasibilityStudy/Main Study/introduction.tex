3D printers have taken over the world over the last decade and
they have
found use in industry, as well as in homes. The convenience of producing
plastic parts at homes gathered attention of many hobbyists and makers. In
industry, the ever-increasing production speed of 3D printers have made
them suitable for rapid-prototyping, saving immense amount of time for
product development and time-to-market. Civil engineers also found use
cases for 3D printers: Mayorship of Istanbul has built its own 3D printed
local service buildings within a week with a fraction of cost and build
complexity.

In this feasibility study, the focus will be on an FDM printer's hotend
temperature measurement with a thermistor.

Hotend temperature must be kept stable as fluctuations in hotend
temperature would cause quality issues on the product, e.g. uneven surface
finish and/or material deposition or nozzle clog. Therefore, the frequency
at which the temperature is measured plays an important role.
