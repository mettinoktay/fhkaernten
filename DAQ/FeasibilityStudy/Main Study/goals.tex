In this feasibility study, the focus will be on an FDM
printer's hotend
temperature measurement with a PTC thermistor.
The goal is to firstly calculate the necessary measurement
frequency, then prove whether it is possible to sense the
temperature at this required frequency, of the component in
which the raw material
would melt without compromising component safety nor
end-product quality,
whilst remaining within the project budget. To reach these
goals, requirements on the next page must be fullfilled.
