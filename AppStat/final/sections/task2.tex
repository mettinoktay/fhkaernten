\section{Fractional Design}

On the lecture notes, the best recipe for fractional design (which is \textit{reduction by factor of 2}) is given as the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write down a full factorial $2^{p-1}$ design.
    \item Complete the design by the $p^{th}$ column, which is calculated by:

    $$
        p = 123...(p-1)
    $$
\end{enumerate}

In our case, p is:
$$123 = \text{V112} \cdot \text{V104} \cdot V_{pump}$$
