\section{Comments on The Quality of The Design}

First thing that comes to attention in the result of the two runs is the abnormal difference between runs \#4. The following formula was used to calculate the difference that's shown in the plot.

$$
\text{per cent difference} = 100*\frac{\text{second run} - \text{first run}}{\text{second run}}
$$

As evident from the graph, runs 4, 7, and 13 are discreapncies of the experiment. Also, the 3 runs (2,3, and 8) that there was no water flow, were also shown to have zero difference.\\

It is unknown to students as to why these discrepancies occured. One would speculate that the external factors are to blame, as 10 other runs show difference in a rather acceptable range.
