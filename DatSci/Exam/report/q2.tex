\section*{Task 2}
In the next step, the sum of $N$ random numbers $(-1,+1)$ should be calculated. This procedure represents a random walk of N steps and leads to the total distance function.
\begin{equation}
    d(N) = Z\uparrow - Z \downarrow
\end{equation}
of a single random walk. Simulate $d(N)$ for the cases $N = 1, 2, 5, 10, 100, \text{and }1000$. Show that the greater $N$ is the better $d(N)$ corresponds to a normal distribution.
